  },

  {
    question: "What is the security deposit for?",
    answer:
      "RND requires a security deposit (minimum $250) before you can drive any car. If your payment type is a debit card, this amount will be deducted from your account; if it is a credit card, the amount will be pre-authorized. In either case, you will be charged when you initially rent the car. However, if the trip is scheduled to begin more than a week from the time you’ve paid for the rental, the security deposit will be charged one week prior to day one of the trip. If the security deposit is declined, your trip will be automatically canceled.

      This deposit will be refunded 72 hours after you return the car in the condition in which you received it. Depending on your bank or payment method, it may take up to seven business days after we release the deposit for the funds to be available in your account. Credit cards will usually be refunded more quickly, as there will be a release of authorization.",
